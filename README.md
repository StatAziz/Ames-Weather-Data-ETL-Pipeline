# Ames-Weather-March-April-2024

## Brief Project Description

This project provides an in-depth overview of the weather in Ames, Iowa for the months of March and April 2024. The data was collected using the Open-Meteo API, an open-source weather API, and processed through a data pipeline built using various AWS services. The project includes analysis of key weather variables and the creation of a comprehensive dashboard to visualize the findings.

## Weather Data Variables
The dataset includes weather data for Ames, Iowa from March 1, 2024, to April 30, 2024. The following variables were collected:

| Column Name          | Data Type | Description                                      |
|----------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| time            | datetime  | The date and time of the recorded data point     |
| temperature_celsius  | float     | Temperature measured in degrees Celsius (째C)     |
| temperature_fahrenheit | float   | Temperature measured in degrees Fahrenheit (째F)  |
| daylight_duration    | float     | Duration of daylight in hours                    |
| sunshine_duration    | float     | Duration of sunshine in hours                    |
| precipitation_sum    | float     | Total precipitation in millimeters (mm)          |
| rain_sum             | float     | Total rain in millimeters (mm)                   |
| wind_speed           | float     | Wind speed in meters per second (km/hr)            |
</br>

</br>
</br>

## key Questions to Answer

1. What was the average temperature in Ames, Iowa during March and April 2024?
2. How did the duration of daylight and sunshine vary throughout these months?
3. What were the total precipitation and rain sums during this period?
4. What was the average wind speed during this period?

</br>
</br>

## Tech Stack

The project utilizes the following AWS services:

- **S3**: Used for storing raw and processed weather data.
- **Lambda Function**: Automated the data collection process by invoking the Open-Meteo API on demand.
- **Kinesis Firehose**: Streamed the collected weather data into specific S3 bucket on real-time.
- **Glue Crawler**: Scanned data in S3, identified its schema and created metadata catalog available for querying using AWS Athena.
- **Athena**: Used to run queries on the processed weather data stored in S3.
- **Glue Jobs**: Processed and transformed the data (performed serverless ETL functions).
- **Glue Airflows**: Orchestrated the workflow of the entire data pipeline, ensuring all tasks are executed in the correct order. 
- **Grafana Lab**: Used to produce dashboards based on the final processed data queried from Athena, providing interactive and visually appealing insights.

The data pipeline architecture involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: AWS Lambda function triggers the Open-Meteo API to collect weather data.
2. **Data Streaming**: Data is streamed into an S3 bucket using Kinesis Firehose.
3. **Data Crawling**: Glue Crawler scans the data in S3 and creates a metadata catalog.
4. **Data Processing**: Glue Jobs process and transform the data as needed.
5. **Data Querying**: Athena is used to query the processed data for analysis.
6. **Workflow Orchestration**: Glue Airflows orchestrates the entire workflow, ensuring smooth execution of each step.

## Key Findings

- The average temperature in Ames, Iowa for March and April 2024 was X째C (Y째F).
- Daylight and sunshine duration showed a gradual increase from March to April.
- The total precipitation and rain sums were Z mm and W mm, respectively.
- The average wind speed during these months was V m/s.

</br>
</br>

## Limitations

- The data is limited to two months, which may not provide a comprehensive overview of long-term weather trends.
- Potential inaccuracies in the weather API data due to sensor errors or data processing issues.
- Limited variables collected; additional variables like humidity and pressure could enhance the analysis.
